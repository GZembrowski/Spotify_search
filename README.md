# Spotify_search
 Is it possible to get a recommendation of future favorite songs using your own music archive and spotify?
The idea is:
take a list of your favorite songs and download their characteristics from spotify.
Then take a list of new albums and let the algorithm decide what you do not have to listen to.
It's Outlier Detection Problem, and more precisely: Novelty Detection.

I tried most popular Sklearn algorithms.
